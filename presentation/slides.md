# Target group

We use dbt every day in our work and it is incredibly important to deliver
it reliably and consistently.

Engineers who...

- do not use Docker to deliver dbt models,
- are looking for a different way to manage dependencies for dbt,
- are looking for more reliable options to deliver dbt models in production.

---

# We want to...

- automate management of dbt version and ecosystem configuration around it,
- make sure that our we CI results are reproducible, 
- make sure that code we deliver is consistent and following our style guide.

---

# Managing dbt version

To manage dependency versions we use <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry">`poetry`</a>.

We decide to go with Poetry because

- we can declare **all** our dbt dependencies in the centralised
  `pyproject.toml`[^1][^2] file,
- Poetry generates `poetry.lock` file, which we can use to reliably create
  environments as in CI as locally,
- many tools around dbt supports `pyproject.toml` as configuration format,
- supported natively by @dependabot.

You optionally can use [pip-tools][pip-tools] or [rye][rye].

```

# Packaging

We build image with our dbt code and deliver it via Container Registry to our
orchestration system.

- We control Python version,
- We encapsulate necessary dependencies and configurations in isolated manner.
- We achieve reproducible builds.
- We allow developers to run CI commands in the same environment as in actual
  CI system (GitHub Actions).

# Conclusions

By using Poetry and Docker we achieved...

- consistency between environments (production, CI and local),
- reproducible builds (easy to deploy and run models across the environments),
- a huge potential for scaling in te future,
- an automation of update with @dependabot.

# Next steps

We are looking for these options in the future...

- getting CI/CD work with a modern CI/CD frameworks (such as [Earthly][earthly]
  or [Dagger][dagger]),
- getting [slim CI][slim-ci] works for us,
- integrate [model versioning][model-versioning] with versioning of our dbt
  model and image.
